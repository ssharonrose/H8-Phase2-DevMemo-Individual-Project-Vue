# H8-Phase2-Individual-Project-Vue

Welcome to my Hacktiv8 Phase 2 Vue Individual Project repository! This repository contains the client-side and server-side code for the "DevMemo" project, which is a web-based application designed for note-taking. DevMemo offers a platform for both private and public usage. When set to public, users can conveniently share their notes, granting everyone access and providing an option to copy the shared content to their personal notes collection.

## Repository Contents

This repository is organized into two main folders: `Server` and `Client`.

- **Server Folder**: Contains the server-side code for the project. This includes server logic, APIs, database interactions, and more.
- **Client Folder**: Contains the client-side code for the project. This encompasses interactive user interfaces, components, and client-side interactions.

## Description

The DevMemo project is my individual project developed during the final phase of Hacktiv8's Phase 2 Vue bootcamp. The application is designed to be a versatile note-taking solution. It allows users to create, manage, and categorize their notes in a user-friendly interface. Notes can be kept private or set to public, enabling users to share their insights and knowledge. Public notes can be copied to a user's personal notes collection for easy access and reference.

The project showcases my proficiency in Vue.js and frontend technologies. Each directory within the `Client` folder represents a specific feature or aspect of the DevMemo application, highlighting my dedication to creating functional and engaging web applications.
